# Bi0 hacking (lite) 

### Work Product - in-progress (these are notes, you are free to use but I would reference only until my initial research and update are complete.  

Applying the hacker ethic to improve their own bodies with do-it-yourself remedies or devices that follow scientific evidenced based findings. The DIY approach can be in defiance of government/industry unwillingness to bring beneficial products to market.  Reasons for this detrimental behavior are many, all having to do with money, "profit" and personal enrichment of corporate elites and their masters.  

>Not to be confused with "Body Hacking" implants, modifications and invasive tech.  Bi0 hacking (lite) refers to managing one's own biology using a combination of medical, nutritional and electronic techniques. May include the use of nootropics, non-toxic substances, and/or cybernetic devices for recording biometric data.  

>A strong belief in the scientific method is critical. Trials and testing would be similar to clinical studies (my definition of Bi0 hacking lite). Many "Grinders", "Body-hackers", "Biohacking", "Biopunk", Transhumanism and Techno-progressivism" individuals exist. All of us aspire to overcome and enhance real or perceived limitations and delays in medical research. 

**Topics or items with a ^ require far greater need for caution.  Please read my Disclaimer along with source and research links.**  
 
 Advances in science and scientific studies in these areas are rapid and growing fast. It is a prerequisite to read the open source,public and grey publications for relavent studies.  Many other precaustions must be considered and discussed and they are to much to go into in this format and topic.

## Iron

Good overview of foods: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/ .  
Studies show iron deficiency was increasingly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:  
Iron deficiency may cause headaches,dry skin:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26314490 .  
 Anxiety: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1540447/.  
 Hair Loss:

What is it?  
What form can it take?  
When should I take it?  
1 hour before meal, or two hour after  
How should I take it?    
Taking some Vitamin C, like in an orange (juice) might be beneficial.  
Avoid (wait 2 hours):   
Foods or drink that have a lot of caffeine in them, like coffee, black tea, and chocolate.  
Avoid milk (products) becaus eof calcium.  
Avoid Calcium or antacid supplments

How much do I need?  
What are natural forms?  
What should I avoid while taking it?  
Wjay are side effects?  

Symptoms:  
Feeling very tired is one of the most common symptoms of iron deficiency, affecting more than half of those who are deficient.  

## Magnesium
Aiding sleep and relaxation it helps decrease cortisol, the “stress hormone
help migraine headaches.  

If you drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea and soda regularly, your risk for magnesium deficiency is increased.

Symptoms of deficiency  
Anxiety?  
Times of hyperactivity?  
Difficulty getting to sleep?  
Difficulty staying asleep?  

Low magnesium is also associated with personality changes and sometimes depression.  Eye twitches, or involuntary eye movements?

When best:  
They are unsubstantiated claims that 1,2 hours before sleep best. but it actually doesn't matter.  

Forms:   
So if you buy magnesium, you always get a magnesium compound, which is associated with another substance, such as magnesium. B.  
Magnesium citrate:  Magnesium bound to citrate, the salt of citric acid.  
 Magnesium carbonate:  Magnesium bound to carbonate, the salt of carbonic acid.  
 Magnesium glycinate: Magnesium bound to the amino acid.  
 Glycine Magnesium orotate: Magnesium bound to orotate, the salt of orotic acid.  
 Magnesium sulfate: Magnesium bound to sulfate, the salt sulfuric acid. Magnesium sulfate is also referred to as Epsom salt or Epsom salts. (Not to be confused with Glauber's salt (= sodium sulfate)).  
 Magnesium oxide: Magnesium bound to oxide, formed during the combustion of magnesium.  
 Magnesium malate: Magnesium bound to malate, the salt of malic acid

Best forms:

*Magnesium Glycinate*. all-around most easily absorbale.is much less dependent on the acidity levels of the stomach.high bowel tolerance level.  Does not cause diarrhea. for better sleep  

*Magnesium taurate*. Good for cardiovascular issues. no laxative properties.

*Magnesium chloride*. aids kidney function and can boost a sluggish metabolism.

*Magnesium malate* -- Magnesium malate is a fantastic choice for people suffering from fatigue

*Magnesium Citrate*.  acidic pH. Mildy laxative.

Worst forms:

*Magnesium Oxide*.used to treat acid reflux and sour stomachs. Not recommended for recommended for those with magnesium deficiencies. poor absorption rate
*Magnesium sulfate*. constipation aid but an unsafe source of dietary magnesium, since overdosing.
*Magnesium glutamate and aspartate* Avoid these two forms of magnesium completely. neurotoxic.

## Vitamin B12
No steadfast rules exist for taking vitamin B-12. For this reason, take the vitamin at the time that’s most convenient for you

You’ll typically see two types of vitamin B12 supplements on the market:  methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin. (Another type, hydroxycobalamin, is also available, but much less common on the market). Don’t let these names confuse you … just remember to be sure you choose methylcobalamin above all other types. You’ll see this listed on the nutrition panel of the supplement on the back; it may also read “methyl” instead of methycobalamin.

## Selenium
## Vitamin D
## Tryptophan

Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning you need to get it from your diet because your body cannot produce it.

First, L-Tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxy L-Tryptophan, or 5-HTP, and 5-HTP is then, in turn, converted into serotonin

*How should I take it*
Tips for making tryptophan work for you:

* Take it with a B-Complex vitamin
* Take it with Ester-C (vitamin C)
* Take all the above with fruit juice
* Make sure you take it on an empty stomach.

## Melatonin

Tryptophan > Serotonin > Melatonin

## Omega-3

### Claims:
#### Supports healthy cholesterol levels
> Supplementing with fish oil may support a healthy blood cholesterol profile already within a normal range. Adding 3-6 grams of fish oil a day can help promote healthy ratios of HDL to LDL, as well as healthy levels of triacylglycerol concentrations in the body when they are already in healthy range.
>
#### Boosts your mood
> Fish oil consumption helps support the levels of serotonin in the body, which is often termed the "feel-good" hormone. You'll typically reap the benefits of serotonin after eating a carbohydrate-heavy meal, which is what puts you in a relaxed and peaceful state. For this reason, individuals typically crave high-carbohydrate foods when they are stressed.

### Air
VOCs – Volatile organic compounds are emitted from hundreds of sources, like household cleaners and appliances, leading to side effects such as headaches and throat irritation.

PM2.5 – Otherwise known as dust, this particulate matter is 2.5 microns in size or smaller and is generated from cooking and burning things. Exposure to too much can lead to lung irritation and runny nose.

Carbon Monoxide – A colorless, odorless gas generated by some appliances and all automobiles that can prevent tissue oxygenation.

Carbon Dioxide – Generated from living and non-living things, this gas can decrease oxygenation and lead to fatigue.

Nitrogen Dioxide – Released by internal combustion engines, this gas can cause lung irritation and inflammation.

Ozone – This is created when nitrogen and VOCs interact in sunlight and can result in breathing problems.

Air Pressure – As measured by a barometer.

Temperature

Humidity – Too much humidity for excessive periods of time can increase the likelihood or mold or mildew accumulation.

## Your Body

### Amino Acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential to forming our muscles, tissues, organs, and glands. They also support human metabolism, protect the heart, and make it possible for our bodies to heal wounds and repair tissues. Amino acids are also essential for breaking down foods and removing waste from our bodies.

#### Essential Amino Acids

An essential amino acid that the body cannot synthesize on its own, so it must be obtained from the diet. Because each organism has its own physiology, the list of essential amino acids is different for humans than it is for other organisms.

histidine
isoleucine
leucine
lysine
methionine
phenylalanine
threonine
tryptophan
valine

#### Non-essential Amino Acids

### Serotonin

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter biochemically derived from tryptophan.

Serotonin appears to affect and/or regulate a number of body functions, including:
1. Digestion ???
2. Blood Clotting ???
3. Bone Density ???
4. Sexual Function ???
5. Mood ???

Most of you mistakenly believe antidepressants create more serotonin, therefore elevating mood.  This is a popular misunderstanding.  The fact is all SSRI antidepressants only trap serotonin between the neurons, creating a pooling effect which elevates mood. L-Tryptophan converts directly to serotonin.

## Symptoms

## serotonin deficiency syndrome

which may manifest as depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, aggression, nervousness, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and migraines ... many of the same symptoms that are being treated today in humans with SSRI's.
